# digitalchordbook

Built Using Create React App, digitalChordbook is an app that allows users to input text from ultimate guitar and automatically create a PDF formatted to fit your device.

Key Features of MVP:
- user can add a single song or an entire book of songs and easily create pdfs to share with collaborators
- recommended formatting executed and displayed as default, but user can make fine tuning changes (change position of chord notation)
- recommended formatting includes:
  - using highlighting and reducing size of subsequent instances of repeating lines (like the chorus for instance)
  - using two to three columns as needed to fit on one page
  - adjusting font size to smallest tolerable size as needed to fit on one page
 
 Potential Additional Features
 - adding "flip page" capability (would have to be for the web version, not the pdf)
